   Paul Mendonza Tribal ChockerOne of the must have jewelry items that will complete your wardrobe is a Choker Necklace. It is truly not important how expensive the piece as long as it is close to the neck accentuating the shoulder lines. A choker necklace must be worn with a open neck shirt and it often looks great with strapless, v-neck, or deep round neck shirts or dresses and are a must have piece for 2012. Keep in mind that you chokers are necklaces that must be worn close or on the neck. For ladies with a long neck you can pick a piece that is a little bolder an upper on the neck, while ladies with a shorter neck you can pick pieces that are a little daintier and that sits below your neck but above your collar bone in order to elongate your neckline.

    Mara Hofman Blue Necklace2012 will be marked by the color blue specially when it comes to fashion and jewels. turquoise tones, navy, aqua, azure, in general blue will definitely be the color of the year. For the girls out there thinking that blue is not their color, you can bet you can find a great blue hue that is just perfect for your skin tone, so you might as well grab a few pieces. In addition to blue, greens and purples be complementary colors, while yellows will give a contrast and the beige, khaki and laveneder tones will soften the year. The trick is to always have few pieces that are in season but always opt for variety when in comes to color and jewelry.

   <p></p>
    Ursus Geode Necklace and PendentGeodes are essentially spherical masses with minerals embedded on its center, such as pyrite and most commonly quarts. Given the rawness of this type of rocks jewelry pieces made with them tend to be very natural and exotic, giving a striking look to the pieces. From small earrings to chunky pendents and rings these type of jewelry is so in for 2012, and has only showed up in the market in the passed few years, since before geodes were only seen as interesteing for home decor, but now it has finally transitioned into jewels.

One of my favorites is the Ursus Maritimus Collection created by jewelry designer, Kimberly McDonald's
